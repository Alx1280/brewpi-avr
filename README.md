brewpi-avr
==========

This is the code that runs on the BrewPi slave (AVR/Arduino)

The newest branch at the moment is the shield branch.
This branch works out of the box with the official BrewPi shields.
This branch will soon become the master branch.

The master branch contains outdated code for DIY shields at the moment.
