brewpi-avr
==========

This is the code that runs on the BrewPi AVR/Arduino

This project uses Git Flow. The development branch is the newest branch. The master branch is the latest stable branch. This branch works out of the box with the official BrewPi shields. If you do not want to add your own code, you can just download the latest HEX file from http://dl.brewpi.com and use the web interface to upload it to your Arduino.
